# movie-recommendation-system-and-visualizatio
It is a movie recommendation and visualization system. The user can select the genre from the 18 genres that are available and the system will show different visualizations with various comparisons such as "year released vs imdb rating", "which directors have movies with highest IMDB ratings and profits" and much more. 

It implements the use of SQL and Microsoft Excel for the data cleaning and Data pre-processing.
Then it uses python for the logic of the project and database is also linked using psycopg2 library.
Then pandas is used for the data frame and the manipulation of the data frame.
I have also used bokeh for the visualization of the data.
Along with this, I have also used libraries for saving the output file and then showing it to web browser.
